I am a postdoc in the Department of Mathematics, University of California, Irvine, working with [Qing Nie](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/qnie/). Previously, I was a postdoc at Michigan State University, supervised by [Guo-Wei Wei](https://users.math.msu.edu/users/weig/). I received  Ph.D. (2020) at University of California, Irvine.

Research Interests
======
My research lies on computational biology by combining computational mathematics and data science to bridge the gap between intricate biological phenomena and their mathematical representation. I am interested in building interpretable artificial intelligence (AI) models by developing and combining deep/machine learning, multiscale modeling, and topological data analysis (TDA) methods.
