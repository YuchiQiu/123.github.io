We are actively recruiting! We are a computational biology lab for single-cell genomics data analysis and protein design. We design and develop computational tools by integrating AI, systems biology, and topological/geometric data analysis for these areas, and collaborate with experimentalists to study developmental, cell and cancer biology, and drug/protein design.

We have multiple Postdoc positions available. PhD students can be admitted through three PhD programs: 1) [Bioinformatics Program](https://bme.uic.edu/graduate/phd-programs/phd-bioinformatics/), 2) [BME Program](https://bme.uic.edu/graduate/phd-programs/phd-bme/), and 3) [GEMS Program](https://chicago.medicine.uic.edu/education/masters-doctoral/gems/apply/). 

If you are interested in a Postdoc or PhD position, please send your inquiry along with your CV, cover letter, research statement, and contact information for 3 references to me (qiuyuchi@uic.edu).
